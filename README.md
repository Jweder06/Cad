# Onshape
Documentation for all Q1 and Q2 cad assignments 

## Teamwork/Pull Copter
 In this assignment we were assigned as student 1 or student 2 and we would do the task parallel accordingly as one student would work on one part of the "spinner" and another would work on another.

### Reflection
This assignment was an excellent beginning to CAD in our first quarter. It forced us to work with a partner and how to use Onshape with someone else rather than by ourselves. I needed to get used to working with others in Onshape because I tend to remember how a part was made and use that knowledge to tell how the future part will be constrained. If someone else makes that part I will have to backtrack and look at their work to use that skill.

## Swing arm 
For this assignment, we were given several Blueprint style drawings and were told to make parts from it that would then later be checked for the correct Mass.

### Reflection
This assignment reintroduced us to CADing from a drawing and was made to help us on our Onshape exam. For me, this is relatively easy except for getting every small detail correct, or else the mass will be a few grams off. The hardest part for me was hunting for small imperfections and correcting them so I could get the perfect mass.

## Multi Part design
This assignment with similar to the previous one except that it involved multiple parts not just a single part Studio and that changes would have to affect multiple Parts dynamically not individualy.

### Reflection
This one was just as difficult as a previous one but for different reasons.  The multipart provided the challenge that multiple  Parts affected each other but made it easier to figure it out single gram differences and and mistakes in individual Parts because each part is separate and not mesured as one. It was also important to remember to change the part matirial not just the dementions. 
##Assembly
For this assignment we where instructed to constrain several parts already made for us, we where then tested by checking the weight mass of the assembly from a mate connector. This assignment was also intended for us to prepare for the Onshape exam.

### Reflection
This was by far the easiest assignment we only had to constrain a few parts with some simple mates. It was relatively easy because if the parts were constrained improperly then they would clip into each other and become identifiable with the part intersection tool.

## Final Onshape exam

### Reflection
The test itself was relatively easy and I finished with 88% accuracy and finished about an hour earlier than most other people. The test prep most definitely helped and contributed to my success as well as almost 500 hours in Onshape.
